# Books to read before I die

This is just a list of books that I found on my various journeys through the internet and found interesting. I have to say that most of the books are either time management or computer science related. So be warned!
The books are split up into different categories and each book is prefixed by a to-do macro to indicate if I already read the book or still have to.
If I'm in the middle of reading a certain book then there will probably be a little note attached which serves me as a bookmark or some notes about the book which I found interesting enough to write down separately.

I created this repository just for the purpose of creating a reading habit inspired by the youtube video called "Read More Books: 7 Tips for Building a Reading Habit" by Thomas Frank (see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiNISuM4wl0). His guideline is as follows:

1. create a daily page goal. (20 or 25 pages)
2. Read in the morning.
3. Read after exercise.
4. Make your reading enjoyable.
5. Eliminate distraction.
6. Anticipate and remove the barriers.
7. Be accountable to externalize your motivation.

I will probably replace the first point of a daily page goal with just a pomodoro session of 25mins because each book differs in its density and my own motivation also fluctuates. Therefore, to eliminate frustration by not reaching a certain page goal, I will just use a timeboxed method of 25mins to keep a maintainable reading pace.
On the other hand, if you would read 20 pages a day that would sum up to 365 * 20 = 7300 pages in a year. If you read 25 pages a day that would sum up to 365 * 25 = 9125 pages in a year.
